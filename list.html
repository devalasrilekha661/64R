    <li><b>What is HTML?</b></li>
    <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language for creating and structuring web pages, defining how
        content like text, images, and links are displayed in a web browser. </p>
    <li><b>What is the difference between HTML and XHTML?</b></li>

    <p><b><u>XHTML</u></b><br><br>
        XHTML stands for Extensible Hypertext Markup Language. It can be considered as a part of the XML markup language
        this is because XHTML has features of both XML and HTML.
        XHTML is extended from XML and HTML. XHTML can be considered as a better version of HTML. <br><br>

        <b><u>Benefits</u></b><br>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Strict syntax:</b></li>
    </ul>
    XHTML has a stricter syntax compared to HTML5,
    which means that it is more structured and easier to read.<br><br>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Standardization:</b></li>
    </ul> XHTML follows the syntax rules of XML, which is a standardized markup language. This makes it easier to create
    interoperable web pages that work well with different web browsers and devices.
    <ul>
        <li><b>Better for parsing:</b></li>
    </ul> XHTML is easier to parse and process than HTML5, which makes it a better choice for developers who want to
    create web pages that can be easily processed by other software tools.<br><br>
    <b><u>HTML</u></b><br><br>
    HTML is the Hypertext Markup Language which is the most widely used language over the internet.
    HTML is used to create web pages and link them from one to another.
    Please note HTML is not a programming language, it is a markup language.
    We can use different other technologies as like CSS and javascript
    to give a new look to the pages developed by HTML. <br><br>
    <b><u>Benefits</u></b><br>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Easier to code:</b></li>
    </ul> HTML5 has a more relaxed syntax compared to XHTML,
    which makes it easier to code.<br><br>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Backward compatibility: </b></li>
    </ul>HTML5 is designed to be backward compatible with older versions of HTML,
    which means that it can be used with older web browsers.<br><br>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Multimedia support:</b></li>
    </ul>HTML5 includes support for multimedia elements such as video and audio,
    which makes it easier to create web pages that include multimedia content.
    <li><b>What is tag?</b></li>
    <p>a "tag" is a keyword or instruction enclosed in angle brackets (<>) that defines an element on a web page. HTML
            tags are the fundamental building blocks used to structure and format content,
            providing instructions to web browsers on how to render text,
            images, links, and other media.</p>
    <li><b>What is the difference between HTML and HTML5?</b></li>
    <p><b><u>HTML</u></b><br><br>
        HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using a markup language. HTML is a
        combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between the web pages. A markup
        language is used to define the text document within the tag which defines the structure of web pages. This
        language is used to annotate (at the note for the computer) text
        so that a machine can understand it and manipulate text accordingly. <br><br>

        <b><u>Features</u></b><br>
    <ul>
        <li>
            It allows the creation of hyperlinks with the <a> tag,
                connecting different web pages.</li>
    </ul><br>
    <ul>
        <li>Uses tags to mark elements and content,
            such as headings.</li>
    </ul><br>
    <ul>
        <li> It supports embedding images, videos,
            and audio for multimedia content.</li>
    </ul><br><br>
    <b><u>HTML5</u></b><br><br>
    HTML 5 is the fifth and current version of HTML. It has improved the markup available for documents and has
    introduced application programming interfaces(API) and Document Object Model(DOM).
    It has introduced various new features like drag and drop, geo-location services <br><br>
    <b><u>Features</u></b><br><br>
    <ul>
        <li>Introduced new semantic elements
            like header, footer, section, and article for improved structure.</li>
    </ul><br>
    <ul>
        <li>Enhances multimedia capabilities with native support for audio and video elements.</li>
    </ul><br>
    <ul>
        <li>Provides the localStorage API,
            allowing web applications to store data locally on the user's device.</li>
    </ul><br>
    <ul>
        <li>Enables websites to access a user's geographical location.</li>
    </ul><br>
    <ul>
        <li>Uses SQL database to store data offline.</li>
    </ul><br>

    <li><b>What are lists?</b></li>
    <p>a list is an element used to create organized and structured lists of items.</p>
    <p>There are 3 types of lists, they are:<br>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Ordered List</b></li>
    </ul><br>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Unordered List</b></li>
    </ul><br>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Defination/Description List</b></li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <li><b>What are attributes?</b></li>
    <p>HTML attributes are special words used within the opening tag of an HTML element to provide additional
        information about that element.
        They modify the element's behavior, appearance, or functionality.
    <ul>
        <li><b>href attribute</b></li>
    </ul><br>
    <ul>
        <li><b>src attribute</b></li>
    </ul><br>
    <ul>
        <li><b>title attribute</b></li>
    </ul><br>
    <ul>
        <li><b>alt attribute</b></li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <li><b>What are elements?</b></li>
    <p>An HTML element is a component of an HTML document that tells a web browser how to structure and interpret a part
        of the HTML document.
        HTML elements can contain formatting instructions, semantic meaning, and content.</p>
